# P2Pay

Open-source, modular Bitcoin payment infrastructure. Accept fiat and crypto across multiple rails. Settle in bitcoin or in the stablecoin that works best for your market.

> **P2Pay is chain-agnostic.** We don't pick chains for ideology — we pick them for what actually works. The settlement layer is Bitcoin or a Bitcoin-native stablecoin, depending on what the market needs and what the best available integration supports. Today that means BTC on-chain, Lightning, and Liquid — because Liquid gives us Bitcoin-native stablecoins such as USDt, BRLz, EURx, and more, without altcoin exposure. That may evolve. The principle won't.

## Core Principles

- **Settlement-first** — bitcoin or a Bitcoin-native stablecoin is the final layer
- **Chain-agnostic** — best rail wins, always
- **Multi-rail** — fiat, cards, P2P, and crypto as entry rails
- **Self-custodial by default**
- **Vendor-neutral**
- **KYC-free where legally possible**
- **Built for failure scenarios, not demo environments**
- **MIT licensed. Forever open.**

## Settlement, Swaps, and Off-Ramps

P2Pay is not only about accepting payments. It is also about moving value across the rails that actually work in each market.

Through Aqua and our wallet fork, swaps between supported currencies will always be possible at the best rate available on the market through the best integration we can expose.

That means a merchant can accept on one rail, settle on another, and still keep spending optionality:

- **BTC / Lightning / Liquid** for native Bitcoin settlement
- **Liquid stablecoins** such as USDt, BRLz, and EURx when local market conditions make them more practical
- **Revolut** as a fiat exit path in Europe
- **Belo** as a LATAM-friendly exit path, especially for BTC and USDT on Polygon
- **Offramp.xyz** as a broader global spending/off-ramp option where supported

The principle is simple:  
**accept where conversion works, settle where custody is strongest, and spend where the region is actually supported.**

Regional and asset availability may vary depending on the provider. Some off-ramp paths may be limited by jurisdiction or supported only for specific assets.

## Active Repositories

### [mono](https://github.com/p2payto/mono)
Main repository. Core application logic, rail integrations, payment flows, dashboard, and mini-app surfaces. Active development happens here.

### [wallet](https://github.com/p2payto/wallet)
Mobile wallet forked from Aqua. Merchant-controlled signing, swaps, and self-custodial settlement flows. Liquid-native by default. Part of the P2Pay architecture, not a standalone product.

### [miniapp](https://github.com/p2payto/miniapp)
Upcoming Nuxt mini app embedded in the wallet. Extends P2Pay payment flows through a wallet-native interface.

## Who This Is For

P2Pay exists for cases where traditional payment stacks break down:

- merchants that need fiat reach without fiat custody
- cross-border businesses with unreliable banking access
- high-risk but fully legal industries
- users in emerging markets
- builders who want modular Bitcoin-native payment infrastructure

If payment platforms work fine for you, P2Pay is not for you. If they don't, this is yours.

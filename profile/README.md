# P2Pagos

Open-source, modular, and agnostic-by-design payment infrastructure built around self-custodial settlement, designed to make cross-border payment flows more practical across markets, rails, and jurisdictions.

P2Pagos uses [BTCPay Server](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver) as the backend and an [Aqua Wallet](https://github.com/AquaWallet/aqua-wallet) fork as the default settlement wallet. Aqua was chosen because it already supports Bitcoin on-chain settlement by default, supports stablecoin-based settlement flows already relevant to the stack today, and can be integrated from BTCPay Server through the Shamrock protocol with a QR-based connection flow.

P2Pagos combines multiple entry rails — local fiat, cards, P2P, and crypto — with settlement in Bitcoin and selected stablecoins. Polygon support is planned in order to integrate at least two of the rails already listed in the planned section. For every chain and payout path supported, the goal is to remain transparent about what is native, what is added by P2Pagos, and what depends on external providers.

Where direct local cashout is not yet native, P2Pagos will do its best to provide practical usage guidance around compatible external wallets, cards, and off-ramp tools — including Apple Pay / Google Pay compatible options where available — to improve real usability in Latin America and other supported regions. Additional cashout paths can also be layered in modularly, as shown in the tables below.

It is designed for users and businesses that need simpler self-custodial payment flows, especially where traditional payment access is limited, fragmented, or overly dependent on a single provider.

## Approach

P2Pagos is designed around a few practical choices:

- **Self-custodial by default**
- **Agnostic in practice** — the usable rail and settlements for best conversion path matter more than ideology
- **Multi-rail** — different markets need different ways to pay
- **Modular** — rails, flows, and services can be enabled or left out depending on the use case
- **Open source** — the public components remain MIT licensed, with long-term maintenance and development supported by revenue from the paid closed-source offering

If a rail does not already settle into an asset supported by the Aqua wallet fork, P2Pagos aims to convert further into the supported asset that is cheapest and most functional for that case.

## Active and Planned Repositories

### [mono](https://github.com/P2Pagos/mono)

Single user orchestrator MIT repository.

It assembles rails, flows, and supporting services into one workspace. Active development is currently centered here.

### [wallet](https://github.com/P2Pagos/wallet)

A MIT fork of the Aqua Flutter Wallet for P2Pagos, with an embedded Nuxt app to manage /mono settings and connect to BTCPay via the Shamrock protocol.

### dashboard

Nuxt-based MIT app, intended to handle payment flows through an embedded interface in the /wallet Flutter app.

### marketplace

Closed-source repository for multi-user marketplace integrations of the /mono repo.

---

## Intended Use Cases

P2Pagos is aimed at cases where standard payment stacks are too limited, too fragile, or too dependent on a single provider.

Typical use cases include:

- cross-border businesses
- merchants that want crypto settlement with broader payment reach
- users in emerging markets
- high-risk but lawful businesses
- builders who want modular, self-hostable payment infrastructure
- Bitcoiners and crypto enthusiasts

It is not meant to be presented as a universal fit for every merchant.

---

## Status

P2Pagos is still evolving.

Some components exist as working integrations, others are partial, experimental, or still being assembled into the main orchestrator. The repositories should be read as active infrastructure work, not as a finished product suite.
